to-do list:

(1) 
need to rename server1, server2 and have incorporate chain in namespacing of servers chain-i-server-j

or... chain-i-head, chain-i-rep1, chain-i-rep2, chain-i-tail

(1.5) change all port in containers to be 8080

(2)
Need to replicate more than once.  Might need some notion of a tail node?  

(3)
Need to add better load balancing than round-robin.  And ping multiple nodes at once and do a system call to check resources

(4) 
Made a simple UI using React

(5) 
Need to add in fault tolerance, e.g. detect if a node dies.
